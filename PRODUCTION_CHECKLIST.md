   - [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to your domain

2. **Database Setup**
   - [ ] Set up production MongoDB instance
   - [ ] Configure `MONGO_URI` for production database
   - [ ] Run database seeder: `cd backend && npm run seed`

3. **Email Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up Gmail SMTP or other email service
   - [ ] Configure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`
   - [ ] Test email functionality

### 🌐 Deployment Configuration
4. **Domain & SSL**
   - [ ] Purchase domain name
   - [ ] Set up DNS records
   - [ ] Configure SSL certificates
   - [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGIN` with your domain

5. **Server Setup**
   - [ ] Set up production server (VPS/Cloud)
   - [ ] Install Node.js 18+
   - [ ] Install PM2 for process management
   - [ ] Configure Nginx reverse proxy

### 📊 Monitoring & Backups
6. **Production Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up application monitoring
   - [ ] Configure error logging
   - [ ] Set up database backup strategy
   - [ ] Configure uptime monitoring

## 🛠️ Deployment Commands

### Quick Start (after environment setup)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm run install-all

# 2. Build frontend
npm run build:frontend

# 3. Start production server
npm run start:production
```

### Full Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url> foiyfoshi
cd foiyfoshi

# 2. Install dependencies
npm run install-all

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp backend/config/env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your production values

# 4. Build frontend
npm run build:frontend

# 5. Seed database (first time only)
cd backend && npm run seed && cd ..

# 6. Start with PM2
pm2 start backend/server.js --name "foiyfoshi-backend"
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## 🔍 Current Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### ESLint Warnings
- Some unused variables in admin components (non-critical)
- Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks (functional, but warnings exist)
- Unused imports in some components

### Performance Optimizations (Optional)
- Image optimization could be improved
- Lazy loading for admin components
- Database query optimization

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Test user registration and email verification
- [ ] Test admin login and dashboard
- [ ] Test product management
- [ ] Test order placement and payment
- [ ] Test email notifications
- [ ] Test image uploads
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate
- [ ] Check page load speeds

### Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Test backup restoration
- [ ] Verify email delivery
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Monitor server resources

## 📞 Support Information

### Logs Locations
- **Application Logs**: `pm2 logs foiyfoshi-backend`
- **Nginx Logs**: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
- **Database Logs**: Check MongoDB logs

### Common Commands
```bash
# Restart application
pm2 restart foiyfoshi-backend

# View logs
pm2 logs foiyfoshi-backend

# Check status
pm2 status

# Update application
git pull
npm run build:frontend
pm2 restart foiyfoshi-backend
```

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Acceptable Performance Metrics
- Page load time: < 3 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms
- Image load time: < 2 seconds
- Database query time: < 100ms

### Scalability Considerations
- Current setup handles ~100 concurrent users
- For higher traffic, consider:
  - Load balancing
  - CDN for static assets
  - Database clustering
  - Caching layers
